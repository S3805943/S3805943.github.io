			<!-- PERSONAL INFORMATION -->
			<h2><center>Personal Information</center></h2>
			<p> Name: Stefan Pratarelli </p>
			<p> Student number: S3805943 </p>
			<p> Email address: spratarelli@outlook.com </p>
			<p> My name is Stefan I like animals big and small, I enjoy computing and learning about new technology. 
			I am an electrician but currently started studying to discover what the world of IT has grown into, which specific field I will go into nobody really knows, as it has become such a vast industry. </p>
			<p> So far I have completed my first university subject which was introduction to programming which was a 
			totally new topic that I had very little knowledge of. It was interesting and I am looking forward to learning more about electronics and how things work on the extra low voltage side of things </p>
			<p> I have sadly never had a dog but currently have 3 rescue cats. It will be a life dream to eventually own my own dog and have room for more animals </p>
			<hr/>
			<h2><center> Interests in IT </center></h2>
			<p> Being an electrician, I have only ever seen IT, I enjoyed gaming as a child but never got into the knowledgeable side of how things work. 
			<p> Electronics has always interested my particularly a YouTube channel called electroBOOM. </p>
			<p> I studied some courses back in high school however I have very little knowledge of what I had learnt and would like to re-ignite an educational pathway </p>

			<p> RMIT was simply offering the subject I need to study online to begin my bachelor’s degree, no other reason.
			I have no idea what I expected to learn as my knowledge of the IT industry is very limited and not very vast.</p>

			<!-- IDEAL JOB -->
			<h1><center> Ideal Job </center></h1>
			
			<a href= "https://www.seek.com.au/job/39801464?searchrequesttoken=35742829-8e39-40ea-99ac-065b359cc1ce&type=standout"target = "_blank"> Seek Article</a>
			
			<p> As I enjoy staying indoors and very much a homebody at times, after reading a blog online </p>
			<a href = "https://www.thesimpledollar.com/10-work-from-home-jobs/" target = "_blank"> 10 Work from home jobs</a>
			<p>The jobs that could be sustainable by living at home, I read up that a web developer can work from home and make enough to earn a living. 
			As we are currently going to put this assignment into a website and present it in a website format, by learning HTML and using Github, it seems interesting that a job like that can be done from the comfort of your own home. </p>
			<p> Mindoon also states on its job application 
			“Minderoo Foundation is made up of seven key initiatives spanning from ocean research and ending slavery, to collaboration in cancer and building communities.”
			This is very appealing towards me as an individual as building communities and taking care of the one world we have is important. </p>
			<h3><center> Skills Required </center></h3>
			<p> They are looking for a trained individual in the programming languages HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS and SQL.</P>
			<P> Dealing with the indigenous community you would need to always maintain a certain level of respect. 
			They look like they need an individual who can adapt to changes and potentially a high paced working environment, Also someone who is sociable and has the ability to bond groups together
			</p>
			<h3><center> Skills I have </center></h3>
			<p> In regards to the web development aspect is bar none, along with ever working in a sole IT based industry/field. </p>
			<h3><center> How will i attain these skills? </center></h3>
			<p> By studying at university and learning the basic fundamentals through education </p>

			<!-- PERSONALITY TESTS -->
			<h2><center> Personality Tests</center></h2>
			<h3><center> Myers Briggs type indicator </center></h3>
			<p> MBTI Results: ISFP </p>
			<a href = "https://s3805943.github.io/MBIT-Test/" target = "_blank">MBTI PersonalityReport</a>
			<article>
				<p> The MBIT test although i thought of it quite critically at first, It has quite accurately defined who I am and
				it is quite satisfying, Hopefully these give a good indicator to individuals that I work with, 
				it also has given me a small boost of confidence knowing that i can break myself down into dot points for others without too much effort				
				</p>
				<p> Some top notes to lead with </p>
				<p> • ISFPs find quiet satisfaction in simple pleasures</p>
				<p> • They are loyal and committed to people important to them.</p>
				<p> • Their warmth, enthusiasm, and playful humor may not be apparent to people
				who don’t know them well.</p>
				<p> • Many ISFPs have a special love of nature and a sympathy with animals.</p>

			<h3><center> Online Learning Style </center></h3>
			<p> I am a <b>Tactile Learner</b> </p>
			<p> If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. 
			You understand and remember things through physical movement. 
			You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or 
			draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of
			physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent 
			breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may
			have difficulty sitting still. </p>
			<p> As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things 
			together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you
			become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability.
			You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering 
			what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you 
			appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back. </p>
			<p> • It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning. </p>
			<p> • Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long). </p>

			<!-- PROJECT IDEA -->
			<h2><center> Project Idea </center></h2>
			<hr/>
			<h3><center> Overview </center></h3>
			<p> The project would be of a small signal box with a LED light. The box will have either a light on or off along with the ability to let out a high-pitched signal which can be heard outside of a switchboard. </p>
			<p> The project would be of a tool designed to inform the owner of back-fed voltage whether it be from high impedance of an electrical circuit along with faults coming from the consumer transformer. </p>
			<p> If under fault conditions the LED light will then turn on along with a high-pitched noise that can be heard from within a certain distance from the switchboard, which in turn informs the owner/company of a fault condition that has arisen, and the appropriate authorities should be called e.g. western power/energy safety. </p>
			<p> This could also have an automatic built in signal which could inform the two company’s individually on the location of the fault if the user is not home.  </p>
			<p> The reason why IT has become more of an interest to me as I have a basic understanding of the electrical infrastructure at 240volts however I believe the world of extra low voltage is the future and can be implemented together to form a sustainable and maintainable world. </p>
			<hr/>
			<h3><center> Motivation </center></h3>
			<hr/>
			<img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/HomeEarthRodAustralia1.jpg" 
			width="350" alt="Earth electrode" align="right">
			<p> To gather some background information, just recently as of March 2018 a young girl had received a fatal shock leaving her in a terrible condition.  </p>
			<a href = "https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-housing-minister-says-its-too-early-to-determine-girls-electric-shock-cause-at-beldon-home-ng-b88764633z"target = "_blank"> First article </a>
			<p> </p>
			<a href = "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-02/denishar-woods-family-receive-$1-million-payment/10679436"target = "_blank"> Second Article </a>
			<p><b> A direct quote from the article states </b>
			“Mr Bunko said open circuit neutrals were less common in new houses because they had a lot of plastic pipework.</p>
			<p> “If you do get electric shocks off taps or you notice that your lights are dimming for no good reason, then you need to report it to the network operator,” he said.</p>
			<p> However, this is not an accurate comment as the removal of copper pipes also sometimes leads to the disconnection of the Earthing bond to the taps, although having an earth steak installed is effective to a certain extent, it may then leave the property unearthed elsewhere. 
			On this note this device would disregard maintenance necessary to the property and would immediately have detected this “open-circuit” and inform the owners or governing bodies. If an incident like this can be avoided for future purposes, then investing money into this project would be more then worthwhile. </p>
			<p> If more extreme instances are necessary maybe total disconnection of the property is necessary along with incorporation of resistance readings from each earthing point in the home. This could then be referenced back to the device. Potentially installing the device along landlines or the NBN system would be an effective position to send signals back to the governing bodies </p>
			<a href = "https://www.ecdonline.com.au/content/business-and-management/article/standards-australia-issues-caution-on-earthing-practices-49127735#axzz5ydjnY8OA"target = "_blank"> Information on Potential Earthing Dangers </a>
			<hr/>
			<h3><center> Description </center></h3>
			<hr/>
			<p> The installation measurements could potentially be installed with reference to access to the incoming telephone lines, as there is generally 2+ pairs coming in from the pit of most homes this could be adapted to a new signal which then goes directly to local housings or establishments that will monitor the readings.  </p>
			<p> The device could be wired in a low voltage setting to most of the earthing requirements necessary however a licenced electrician would be advised as metering from the incoming supply would be necessary. Along with maybe some base readings from each specific distribution transformer with co-operation to the supplying company. This device could ensure the correct readings from the:
<center><p>•	MEN link
<p>•	Main earth conductor 
<p>•	Main supply - receiving readings from the incoming neutral and active 
<p>•	Equipotential bonding
<p>•	Reading current supply/current availability 
<p>•	All 3 phases active 
<p>•	Measure the voltage being regulated daily
<p>•	Inrush current times (Dinner time and breakfast)
<p>•	Measure the off-peak/on peaks of the house hold
<p>•	Incorporate a system with previously installed energy supplies to potentially feed back into the grid
<p>•	Working with solar panels to help regulate voltage between the grid and solar due to sunny but cloudy days, this in turn will help lower over voltage in high voltage installations
<p>•	Detect over/undervoltage</p></center>

	<p> Trial and error would be the best form of distinguishing if base models and extra 
	models would need to be created. Potentially a WIFI adaptor to then be installed for 
	instances where the incoming lines can not be accessed or is not easily accessible for 
	the installation of the primary device. </p>
	<p> The service could then be inspected every 3-6 months depending on the installation 
	type, potential for lithium-ion long lasting batteries the same as what is in smoke alarms
	if a actively ready supply is not able to be installed. It may also have a separate 
	feature where it will inform the owner if they have lost power but not power from the 
	consumer mains. This could also be an easily accessible replacement as it can be 
	maintained by the owner, but if the battery is running too low or the installation 
	is not correct the device should maintain a continuous noise.
	</p>
	<p> If it is more then a certain amount of time the correct authorities should be 
	contacted in which the customer can be contacted. This could be a flow chart of the 
	steps necessary and if the customer cannot be contacted within a certain amount of time 
	then an automatic inspection should take place. This however would need to be incorporated
	to comply with AS 3000 2018 and to ensure that the interference of such a device into the
	earthing system does not cause any disturbances between RCD’s or other devices along with 
	ensuring it does not create any parallel paths within the current electrical installation
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<h3><center> Tools and Technologies </center><h3>
	<hr/>
	<h3><center> Hardware </center></h3>
<p>•	Potentially some sort of wiring</p>
<p>•	A small box to be mounted either inside a switchboard housing or next to a modem</p>
<p>•	An exterior weatherproof box that the unit could be installed inside of as small electronics can be easily damaged by weather conditions</p>
<p>•	Connection points depending on if the unit is power by 240v or a low voltage supply incoming from the phone lines. This all depends on how far of a system is put into place and whether the current suburb has been setup to receive such communications</p>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <h3><center> Software </center></h3>
 <p> A system would have to be implemented to have some base values to be given as maximum 
 and minimums. This would have to be a set standard of values in compliance with AS 3000:2018 
 as what would be considered the minimum and maximum value allowed for each individual 
 application in regards to the resistance for earthing, the impedance necessary coming in 
 from the transformer/incoming supply and the maximum and minimum voltages allowed throughout 
 a 24 hr cycle </p>
 <hr/>
 <h3><center>Skills required </center></h3>
 <p> A potential to be a licenced electrician would be necessary to install the product 
 anywhere within a low voltage situation. Any item within a switchboard or containing 240v 
 must be installed and certified by a licenced electrician. Some infrastructure knowledge 
 is necessary along with telecommunications knowledge of where the phone lines are coming in </p>
	<p> If the units are already pre-programmed, then a plug and play instance could be 
	implemented however depending on the land and location and premises of where the product 
	is being installed then certain values may need to be altered. As different sized 
	conductors have different readings.So potentially each unit would have to be programmed 
	depending on the premises of the installation along with the size and type of the consumer
	transformer. 
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <h3><center> Outcome </center></h3>
 <p> If the project did become a success, I would prefer the outcome to be a low cost and 
 effective product available to all individuals. Plus a program to be implemented for those 
 that are not fortunate enough to be able to afford certain safety precautions then a certain 
 percentage of the sales of the products sold would be handed to those with a discounted 
 installation price.  </p>
 <p> This in turn could eventually become a main distribution centre along with local suburbs
 containing smaller units which then can be read and accessible to anybody from all around the
 world, This system could be implemented world wide and would be incorporated into different 
 wiring systems along with handling 120v, ring circuits, running earth systems, MEN systems, 
 sub-mains, individual dwellings, companies, factories and potentially in the future large 
 scale high voltage situations. </p>
 
 <p> Although I do believe some sort of monitoring system is in 
 place for the larger scale community
